# TMS-strength-duration-time-constant-and-rheobase-estimation---Group
The objective of this code is to estimate the strength-duration (SD) time constant and rheobase from cTMS neural strength-duration curve data across a population of subjects when assuming a single, common SD time  constant across subjects and individual rheobase for each subject.
